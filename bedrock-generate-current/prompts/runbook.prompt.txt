Create an on-prem oriented runbook for Oracle 18c -> 23ai migration/upgrade using Data Pump.

Output Markdown with:
- Preconditions (approvals, backups, rollback artifacts)
- Execution steps (export, import, retries policy, logging)
- Validation steps (invalid objects proof, row-count proof, ORA checks)
- Rollback plan with checkpoints
- Known risks pulled from evidence (ORA codes and ORA-39082 objects)

Constraints:
- Use only EVIDENCE_JSON.
- If something is missing, write Unknown and keep steps generic/safe.
- Include explicit "Human approval required" gates for production cutover.
