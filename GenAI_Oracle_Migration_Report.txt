GENAI-ASSISTED ORACLE MIGRATION REPORT
=====================================

Project: Oracle 18c XE → Oracle 23c migration
Cloud: AWS Lambda + Amazon Bedrock (GenAI analysis)
Region: us-east-1

Artifacts analyzed:
- precheck.log
- expdp_legacy_18c.log
- impdp_legacy_23c_retry2.log
- validation_23c.log

Key findings:
- Migration completed; schema LEGACY_APP present on target.
- Row-count validation succeeded (ORDERS = 50000).
- One intentionally invalid object detected post-migration: LEGACY_APP.BAD_VIEW (expected upgrade pain).

Recommendations:
- Recompile invalid objects (utlrp.sql) and refactor invalid view dependencies.
- Validate application SQL compatibility for Oracle 23c.
- Run post-migration regression tests and performance checks.

Status: SUCCESS with minor remediation required.

Generated as GenAI evidence artifact for portfolio.
